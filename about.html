<h3>
	House
</h3>
<p>
House is a genre of electronic dance music characterized by a repetitive four-on-the-floor beat and a typical tempo of 115 to 130 beats per minute. It was created by DJs and music producers from Chicago's underground club culture in the 1980s, as DJs from the subculture began altering disco songs to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines.

<h3>
	Minimal Tech
</h3>
<p>Minimal techno is a subgenre of techno music. It is characterized by a stripped-down aesthetic that exploits the use of repetition and understated development. Minimal techno is thought to have been originally developed in the early 1990s by Detroit-based producers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell. By the early 2000s the term 'minimal' generally described a style of techno that was popularized in Germany by labels such as Kompakt, Perlon, and Richie Hawtin's M-nus, among others.

<h3>
	Tech-House
</h3>
<p>Tech house is a subgenre of house music that combines stylistic features of techno with house. The term tech house developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, such as "rugged basslines" and "steely beats," with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house. The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK

<h3>
	Techno
</h3>
<p>Techno is a genre of electronic dance music (EDM) characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat which is generally produced for use in a continuous DJ set. The central rhythm is often in common time (4/4), while the tempo typically varies between 120 and 150 beats per minute (bpm). Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines, sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular.

<h3>
	Melodic Techno
</h3>
<p>Melodic house is a house music subgenre that has a heady, melodic, arpeggiator-heavy sound. The genre has close ties with melodic techno with the differences that mostly characterize the difference between house and techno. Both genres derived from progressive house, while melodic house also draws its roots in the early 2010s deep house scene and thus remains more beat-oriented, retaining house structure. Melodic techno has a more atmospheric and hypnotic sound, with emphasis on arpeggiated minor melodies closely tying it with progressive trance. The tempo of the genres stays around 120 bpm, while melodic techno could be slightly faster sometimes, but usually not higher than 130 bpm. Melodic house artists known to make this genre include Dixon, Solomun, Kidnap Kid, Lane 8, Bicep and CamelPhat. Melodic techno artists are Maceo Plex, Tale of Us, Kölsch and Boris Brejcha.
